In this the first page is one that has my resume on it. it talks about my contacts where you can reach me. then is has a link to download the pdf version of my resume for it. The next part is the job i have had in the past and what i did at that place. Then i goes on to talk about my education from now until may 2023 i am at iit getting a bachelor in computer science and what highschool i went to and clubs and grades there. then the last section is about some of the coding languages i have learned so far at the school and coding i understand how to do. Then on the second page it is a about me page it has a headshot of myself and then i say my name and age. I then talk about my self what i like to do in my spare time and about my personaility with others and myself.

If i had more time i would definaly want to do more with the css but when i try and do things in it i get weird things don't work or i just don't understand how to do the styling in css compared to html which i find much easier to do and style the page how i want it because in this class is the first time i am working with html and css.
